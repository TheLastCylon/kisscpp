<div class="textblock"><p>Well, there are actually several reasons, but the most important ones are listed here.</p>
<h1>Bad code</h1>
<p>I used to work in an environment where I had to maintain source code containing C functions, spanning 2000 lines. One or two such functions would not really have bothered me, as I would simply conclude that the code was done under pressure, and a re-factor was in order. The problem here though, was the 37 near duplicate functions each spanning said 2000 lines of code.</p>
<p>At one point, I was convinced that this kind of code, was a result of incompetent developers in that environment. I was partially correct, in that there were developers that were incompetent. However, this was a reflection of management and the prevailing employment strategies, as well as a non-existent internal communication structure.</p>
<p>It was the kind of environment, where non-technical people were placed in senior technical positions, resulting in decisions around tooling being made by people who never use the tools.</p>
<p>Sadly, I'm not exaggerating. If I were, I'd probably still be working in that environment.</p>
<p>In short though, it was the typical Waterfall development, perpetuated by a poor implementation of the Rational Unified Process, where hamstrung project-managers had no choice but to pester hamstrung developers into hacking a 15 year old, poorly designed system, so as to provide the appearance of valuable solutions to the business.</p>
<p>KISSCPP is the culmination of frustration and experience, into a library that will make it possible for developers at large corporates, to deliver re-factored components, at a fraction of the cost of maintaining old ones.</p>
<p>Yes, the system will have to be re-designed to make use of KISSCPP, but the cost would be ridiculously low compared to maintaining a system like the one I had to deal with.</p>
<h1>Development speed</h1>
<p>Over the years I've had to listen to the "My language is better than yours" debate, one too many times. The more I listened to these debates, the more I realized that there are several types of Software Developers.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><b>Those that don't know.</b> <blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>These are the ones, that are just starting out. They are totally new to the industry and can be forgiven almost anything.</p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><b>Those that think they know.</b> <blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>These are the ones that will blindly stick to a single programming language/ tool/methodology/paradigm etc. They will happily argue that a business will only need the tool they happen to be proficient in. They are also the kind of developer that will argue, that Delphi is a programming language and PHP is fast enough to be used as a tool for creating a database cache service.</p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li><b>Those that know.</b> <blockquote class="doxtable">
<p>These are the ones that actually get qualified in multiple programming languages, using diverse paradigms. They are the ones that will convince a business of the need for a multitude of tools and skills to manage it's own software. They will prescribe PHP for the web requirements, Java for business components, C++ for the components that feel the need for speed, C for those that feel the need for warp speed, assembler for trans-warp speeds and machine code for instantaneous teleportation.</p>
<p></p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There is a particular kind of the "Think they know" developer, that I aim to address, using the KISSCPP library. They are the ones who argue, that getting something done in C++ takes too much development effort. With the release of KISSCPP and the various applications that use it, I aim to demonstrate just how fast one can develop in C++, when you are willing to standardise your development and/or design.</p>
<p>The only advantage a programming language like Java has over C++, is that JAVA developers have been forced to standardise their solutions.</p>
<p>KISSCPP is a step in that direction, for C++ developers. </p>
